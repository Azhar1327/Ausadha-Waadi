# Auṣadha-Waadi

* An online management tool called Auṣhadha-wadi is used to oversee a number of activities carried out at government-run healthcare facilities, such as the distribution of free medication and free lab testing.

* This will enable patients to acquire free medications and look up all nearby government-funded health care options.

* The website allows a patient to view the medications and lab tests that are offered at nearby healthcare facilities and gain access to them by visiting the facility.

* Each patient will receive a personalized dashboard where they may view various facts such as their prior medical histories, the medications that are now available, request an unavailable medication, and schedule various lab tests available.

* Every healthcare facility will have a number of administrators or operators who have access to numerous resources including updating the inventory of medications, scheduling lab tests, informing patients of various details, and exercising greater control over patients.
